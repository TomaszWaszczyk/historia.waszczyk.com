### 2020

A collapse in the currency, soaring inflation and spiralling unemployment are convulsing Lebanon, which has been in deep financial crisis since October. A shutdown to fight the new coronavirus has made matters worse for the economy.

Overnight, protesters in Tripoli set several banks and an army vehicle on fire. Soldiers fired in the air and used tear gas and rubber bullets, a security source said. The man who died was in his 20s and it was not immediately clear who was responsible for his death, the source said.

Protesters returned on Tuesday, setting two banks on fire and smashing their facades, prompting the army to redeploy. Dozens of soldiers positioned themselves in a street lined with several banks, and some fired rubber bullets and tear gas.
