### 1933

Glass-Steagall was passed by the House of Representatives. It was passed by the Senate on May 25, 1933. It was signed into law by President Roosevelt on June 16, 1933, as part of the New Deal. It became a permanent measure in 1945. 

After the law passed, banks had one year to decide whether they would become investment or commercial banks.
