<!-- You might not be interested in war, but war is interested in you. 

The entire world launched two wars in 2020, the war on covid and the war on currency. Covid war is about your health and digital transformation. Currency war is about your purchasing power and monetary expansion.

"There are decades where nothing happens, and there are weeks where decades happen." 

Digital transformation went from being a buzzword to becoming eternalized in our society. It transformed many people's ideas about health, wealth, relationship, money, and the future.

Humans have evolved to become APEC creatures of the planet; We made it because we invent new technologies by channeling different forms of energy to make things harder, smarter, faster, and stronger.

Let's use fire as an example.

Fire is one of the prime technology/energy networks humans invented and mastered.

When we started a fire, we released latent energy in matter; we converted matter into energy. We channeled and tapped into this energy to survive in the jungle.

When humans started to harvest energy, we began to evolve at a very rapid rate. 

We can use fire to play offensively or defensively; Cooking with fire enabled us to pre-digest food, which increased the efficiency of converting broader scope of food into calories.

When we can metabolize the food 10 times more efficiently than other animals, the excessive energy stored in our body that is not used to digest food can be re-directed for other activities.

Fire is the elemental force of energy channeled by human ingenuity into making things better.

!!Understanding the conservation of energy helps us better understand Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a technology network humans created to channel monetary energy, the highest form of energy humans can channel. Why? Because our time is money, money is energy, money stores human time.!!

Remember we mentioned the war on currencies? A small group of people with the power to expand the money supply means they waged war on our money, the purchasing power money represents.

We are told inflation is good and necessary. What that means is we are told it is ok that our money is worth less over time. We trade our time and energy for money. When they dilute our money, our time is getting robbed.

Bitcoin is an engineered immutable, permissionless technology and network protocol to help humans transfer monetary energy through time and space without a third party. It is designed as a bare instrument base settlement layer that can not be controlled, manipulated by anyone.

The invention of bitcoin is akin to the discovery of fire. For the first time in human history, we found a way to protect our time energy that no one else can steal. Bitcoin is the fire created in cyberspace.

Do you know #Bitcoin is declared dead by mainstream media 422 times since 2009? Do you know why it's still alive and growing stronger every single day? Because #bitcoiner are the keepers of the flame.

#Bitcoiners have the deepest conviction to defend and improve #Bitcoin and its network. If you take some time to dig into what Bitcoin represents and what it does to better yourself and humanity, I am certain you will join them, amongst the greatest fight of our lifetime.

The fluctuation and volatility of bitcoin in the past decade is due to its early stage in the adoption curve.

Its price discovery will settle once reached mass adoption in this decade. 

It's a asymmetric bet like the early stage of involving in internet.
