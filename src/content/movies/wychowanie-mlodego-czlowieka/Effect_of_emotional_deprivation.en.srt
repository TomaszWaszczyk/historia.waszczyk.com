1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,133
Children raised under favourable family conditions

2
00:00:07,856 --> 00:00:16,140
Emmanuel, raised by his family, is an active explorer and eager to grab any new object he sees

3
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:22,835
He moves it from hand to hand, and brings it up to his mouth for example

4
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:48,448
He is completely absorbed by the activity, and pays little attention to those around him

5
00:00:51,120 --> 00:01:00,682
Christine, who regularly attends a nursery, does not behave much differently

6
00:01:02,744 --> 00:01:08,355
She handles the block with both hands

7
00:01:16,054 --> 00:01:24,179
Tries to stack them, and picks them up when they fall

8
00:01:24,893 --> 00:01:29,447
She too is totally absorbed by the game

9
00:01:31,243 --> 00:01:35,443
These two examples show us children whose families offer them complete security

10
00:01:35,483 --> 00:01:45,442
On the other hand, when family conditions are unfavourable to the point of requiring a child's removal from the home, the child’s behaviour will be affected as follows

11
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:49,988
Institutionalized children

12
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:57,904
Caroline, a victim of maternal neglect, is anorexic

13
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:09,009
She picks up one of the blocks, but shows only fleeting interest in playing

14
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:18,773
She frequently looks at the experimenters in the room

15
00:02:18,813 --> 00:02:24,959
She engages in some play, but is preoccupied by those around her

16
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:36,844
In the next cases we also see increased attention paid by the child to his environment, and a correlating decrease in attention paid to the game.

17
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:47,070
For example, Veronique, who is also anorexic, expresses refusal by raising her hands in an avoidance gesture

18
00:02:56,115 --> 00:03:03,301
When she finally picks up a block, the worried looks she casts suggest anxiety

19
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:07,341
Her demeanor is passive, she does not play

20
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:21,420
Jean, who was removed from her home at a young age and institutionalized after several failed foster placements, carefully watches the movements of the psychologist

21
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:32,766
An emotionally deprived child may prioritize social contact, which could be motivated by the child’s intense desire to find a maternal substitute

22
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:44,683
Her curiosity in new objects is minimal

23
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:51,768
She accepts without resistance when the block is placed in her hand, but shows no real interest

24
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:03,668
René, whose case is similar, sits motionless in front of the blocks

25
00:04:15,728 --> 00:04:27,914
After a while, he makes a motion for the block, but is plagued by such anxiety that little by little he becomes totally disinterested in the game and those around him

26
00:04:31,294 --> 00:04:40,546
He withdraws into himself and take refuge in the self-soothing activity of thumb sucking

27
00:04:45,381 --> 00:04:49,787
Annette who is also anorexic, has an attitude of immobility

28
00:04:49,827 --> 00:04:54,360
She is completely disinterested in her surroundings

29
00:05:01,305 --> 00:05:09,340
Her growing anxiety manifests by twitching lip movements and irregular breathing

30
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:23,086
Autism can be discerned from the vague gaze of this little girl

31
00:05:26,245 --> 00:05:37,107
Here we see Colette, also deprived of affection and care, showing the same symptoms of autism and anxiety. She remains still, and breathes heavily

32
00:05:42,094 --> 00:05:59,286
Thus, emotional deprivation provokes not only the anxiety that is well known to psychologists, but also inhibits the child’s exploratory instincts and curiosity in new objects, and may result in autism in the most serious cases
